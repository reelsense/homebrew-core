# Please always follow these steps:
- [ ] Confirmed this is a problem with only one, specific formula and not Homebrew/brew? If it's a general Homebrew/brew problem please file this issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/new
- [ ] Ran `brew update` and retried your prior step?
- [ ] Ran `brew doctor`, fixed as many issues as possible and retried your prior step?
- [ ] Ran `brew gist-logs <formula>` (where `<formula>` is the name of the formula that failed) and included the output link?
- [ ] If `brew gist-logs` didn't work: ran `brew config` and `brew doctor` and included their output with your issue?

To help us debug your issue please explain:
- What you were trying to do (and why)
- What happened (include command output)
- What you expected to happen
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions (by running `brew install` commands)
